			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>SCOBY</li>
				<li>6 cups Black tea</li>
				<li>1.5 cups sugar</li>
				<li>1 lb ripe blueberries (fresh or frozen)</li>
				<li>1 lb ripe mango (fresh or frozen)</li>

		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Brew tea.</li>
				<li>Add tea, sugar, and water to a 1.5-gallon jar. The jar should be about 80% full, with space for the
					SCOBY plus about 1 inch of air at the top.</li>
				<li>Add scoby to lukewarm tea. </li>
				<li>Let scoby sit for 5-7 days. Make sure the scoby jar is covered with a breathable material such as a
					coffee filter or a clean towel.</li>
				<li>Place fruit in bottom of empty glass jars. You can use one empty gallon or eight 16oz jars.</li>
				<li>Remove the solid scoby from the first jar, then pour the liquid from the scoby jar into the jars
					with fruit.</li>
				<li>Screw the lids tightly onto the jars, and let them sit in a cool, dark place for 3 days.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Suggested serving</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Enjoy as a cool refreshing drink on a hot summer's day, or as an early morning pick-me-up.</li>
				<li>Kombucha is a great subsititute for soft drinks.It has a lower glycemic index than fruit juice, no
					artificial
					ingredients, and the good bacteria from the SCOBY gives your digestive system a boost. Win-win-win!
				</li>
				<li>There is a small amount of naturally-occuring caffeine in Kombucha from the black tea. This makes
					kombucha an excellent substitute for coffee or other caffeinated beverages.</li>

				<li>It's not recommended to drink Kombucha at night, unless you plan to stay awake late. The caffeine
					can keep your brain running much longer than it would otherwise.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Tips</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>SCOBY stands for 'Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast'. This SCOBY is what forms the basis for
					your Kombucha.</li>
				<li>The length of fermentation will vary based on the strength of the scoby and how strong you want your
					kombucha to be. Generally speaking, kombucha that has sat longer (e.g 7 days or more) will taste
					more like vinegar, while scoby that is less fermented (7 days or less) will taste sweeter.</li>
				<li>Before you add the SCOBY to the tea, make sure the tea has cooled to lukewarm or room temperature.
					Too much heat can kill the SCOBY.</li>
				<li>There is a small amount of alcohol in Kombucha. Most store-bought kombucha has less than 0.5%
					alcohol, which is why it can be listed as a non-alcoholic beverage.</li>
				<li>There are variants of kombucha that have more alcohol. Enjoy responsibly - or not at all.</li>
